                your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

            <p>By using the 101 Sites, submitting information or using any of our products and/or services, you are
                agreeing with and accepting the terms and the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not

                Media Lab does not control or own, or individuals that 101 Media Lab does not employ or manage.</p>

            <p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, please read our Terms &amp; Conditions (available at
                hypemaker.co/terms). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is part of, our Terms &amp;

                constitute your agreement with and acceptance of the changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

            <p>Thank you for visiting hypemaker.co. This Privacy Policy is written to better explain how we collect and
                use your personal data. This Privacy Policy is a binding contract and you must agree to it to the same
                extent as our Terms &amp; Conditions in order to use our services.</p>

            <h3>2. Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>

            <p>The 101 Sites generally collect personally identifying information (such as, for example, your name,
                email address, contact address, phone number, payment information, date of birth, etc.) with your

                provide us with certain personal data, but we may not be able to process your orders, transactions or
                applications, or you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features such as posting
                on our forums.</p>

                complete a registration form. As part of this registration forum, we require your email address and date
                of birth. Please note that if you do not provide all the required personal data to us or if the data
                provided is inaccurate, we may not be able to process your registration and you may not be able to post
                on our forum or use selected parts of our website. Optional information such as your referrer or time
                zone may also be requested.</p>

            <h3>3. Public Areas</h3>

            <p>When you post, contribute or share any content to a public area of the 101 Sites such as our
                HYPEBEAST.com Forum or comments sections, the content you submit will be made available to the general
                public. To protect your privacy, we would recommend that you exercise caution when submitting, sharing
                or posting on such public area any personal data or sensitive information such as but not limited to
                your full name, address, phone number, or any other information that would allow other users or third
                parties to locate you or obtain information about you. You are entirely responsible for your use of our
                websites, for all of the contents that you submit or post on our websites, for any and all activities
                that occur under your account, and for ensuring, protecting and safeguarding the confidentiality and the
                security of your account. We shall not be held liable for any claims, loss or damage resulting from a
                breach of the foregoing, or your use of and contributions on our websites, or any unauthorized use of
                your account.</p>

            <h3>4. Personal Data We Collect When You Buy from Us</h3>

                address, date of birth, Paypal information and telephone number. If you do not provide the required
                personal data to us or if the data provided is inaccurate, we may not be able to process your order. We
                will use your personal data to process your order and for the purposes as set out in this Privacy
                Policy, and we will not disclose any personal data that you provide to us except in accordance with the
                provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>5. Automatic Information</h3>

            <p>Our servers may automatically collect automatic and/or aggregate information about your computer or
                electronic device when you visit our websites, including without limitation the website that referred
                you, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, the type and configuration of the internet browser of your
                computer or electronic device, browsing preference such as language settings and font size, geo-location
                information and operating system of the computer or electronic device used for accessing our websites,
                and other usage and traffic information. 101 Media Lab uses this automatic and/or aggregate information
                to analyze trends, gather and prepare statistics or demographic information and administer our websites
                so that we may provide improved web experiences to our users. Such automatic and/or aggregate

                and/or aggregate information, which are not personal data, to our partners about how our users,
                collectively use our websites. We may share this information with our partners, so that they may further
                understand the usage of their areas and our websites, so that they too can provide you with a better web
                experience. There may also be occasions when we are legally required to disclosure or provide access to
                our database in order to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings or otherwise
                comply with any applicable laws or regulations, court order or lawful requests from any government
                authority. In those instances, the data is provided only for that purpose. For the avoidance of doubt,
                this Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of such automatic and/or
                aggregate information.</p>

                and/or databases (as the case may be). To the fullest and maximum extent as is permitted under the
                applicable laws, you agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if
                we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action

            <p>Additionally, we may store your personal data or share them with other third parties as set out in Clause

                applicable laws, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the
