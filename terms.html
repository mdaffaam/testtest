            <p>Refer us to your friends and they'll get 10% off their first order. In addition, you'll receive 20%
                commission for their first purchase. Visit <a href="https://hbx.com/referral">https://hbx.com/referral</a> to start inviting your friends!</p>

            <h3>1. Inviting Friends and Earning Referral Commission:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Register with us and download our HBX app to receive a unique referral ID code. The code will be
                    sent to your email once your registration is completed.
                </li>
                <li>Share your referral code with friend(s) and they will get 10% off their first order (note: they must
                    be new customers).
                </li>
                <li>Once your friend(s) place their order, you will receive a credit worth 20% of their order. The
                    credit can be found in your HBX account and is valid for 90 days from the date your friend(s) placed
                    their order.
                </li>
                <li>There is no limit to the amount of Referral Commission you can accrue into your account.</li>
                <li>If two people refer the same friend, the commission will only be applied to the referrer whose code
                    was used.
                </li>
                <li>This offer is limited to one referral and email address per friend. Friends who register using
                    multiple accounts or email addresses will be subject to account termination and all corresponding
                    discounts, credits and commissions will be canceled.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Spending Referral Commission:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Referral Commission may only be spent on purchases with conditional products including full priced,
                    sale, shipping, and special products.
                </li>
                <li>Referral Commission cannot be used to buy gift cards and marketplace items. Free shipping does not
                    apply when spending Referral Commission.
                </li>
                <li>Your Referral Commission will be applied automatically to eligible products during checkout. The
                    first commission credit to expire will be applied first.
                </li>
                <li>Referral Commission cannot be used in conjunction with other coupon codes or discounts available.
                </li>
                <li>Referral Commission is restricted from certain brands.</li>
                <li>There is a minimum spend of USD100 on orders using Referral Commission.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Prohibitions</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>HBX reserves the right to cancel your Referral Credits if it determines in its sole discretion that
                    you have violated these terms through fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by
                    inviting fake people to join, using false names, using multiple email accounts or email addresses,
                    impersonating another person or otherwise providing false or misleading information to us) or if we
                    terminate your account for any reason. You may also be liable for civil and/or criminal penalties
                    under applicable law.

            <p>As we are located in Hong Kong, we have certain defenses available to us for liability for defamation
                posted on our website by third parties, such as in our forums or on our blog. We recommend that you
                review the decision of the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Court of First
                Instance in the case of Oriental Press Group Ltd. and Another v. Fevaworks Solutions Ltd. Specifically,
                the law in Hong Kong is that we are a "subordinate distributor" and not automatically liable for the
                defamatory material of another who posts on our website.</p>

            <p>Our Online Community Policy (described above) prohibits defamation from being published on our website.
                In order to complain about defamatory material on our website, please notify us with full details of
                where the defamation is located on our website (provide us with the URL), your name, and an explanation
                of how the material is defamatory. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe and, if it appears that
                there are grounds to believe the material is defamatory, we will remove it. You may send your request to
                <a href="mailto:info@hypebeast.com">info@hypebeast.com</a>.</p>

            <p><u>Special Note to American Users</u></p>

            <p>Please note that if you are thinking of suing us in the United States, Section 230 of the Communications
                Decency Act prohibits you from holding us liable for the comments of a third party. Additionally, the
                SPEECH Act prohibits you from enforcing in the United States any judgments obtained against us in a Hong
                Kong court for a third party’s defamatory statements, and if you attempted to sue us in a Hong Kong
                court for the actions of a third party our lawyers would make a motion in the U.S. courts where your
                deposition is to be taken to prevent such a deposition from occurring. Therefore, we stress the
                importance of following the proper Hong Kong notification procedure as described above.</p>
